THE TASK:
Find the largest half-path between the vertices of the tree whose sum of vertex keys is maximal,
and delete (by right deletion) first the central vertex of this half-path, if it exists,
then the root of the same half-path, if it was not at the same time the central vertex of this half-path. Perform a forward left traversal of the resulting tree.
The input file contains a sequence of numbers - the keys of the vertices in the order they were added to the tree.
