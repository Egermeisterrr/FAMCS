# Binary Tree Task:
CONDITION: Find the largest half-path between the vertices of a tree whose sum of vertex keys is maximal, and delete (by right deletion) first the central vertex of this half-path, if it exists, then the root of the same half-path, if it was not simultaneously the central vertex of this half-path. Perform a straight left traversal of the resulting tree.

INPUT FORMAT: The input file contains a sequence of numbers â€” the keys of the vertices in the order of addition to the tree. It is guaranteed that there are at least two vertices in the tree.

OUTPUT FORMAT: The output file must contain a sequence of vertex keys obtained by a direct left traversal of the resulting tree.
